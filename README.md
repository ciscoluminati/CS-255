Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is an application that was initiated to help student drivers practice more for the driving test and the written test too. The application is a web-based application that allows the customer to make appointments with a driving instructor to practice driving and take online classes to learn the rules of the road. It is an application that offers different packages to the customer to get accustomed to their learning experience. The application requirement was to have a web-based application, allow to export certain data on an excel file, link the application to the DMV database so that the written practice test stays updated.

What did you do particularly well?
Gathering the requirements was the easiest part.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I will rework my sequence diagram. There is always a way to improve it by adding an end of process at the end of the lifeline of the entity I assume I did assume that they would not need one. I was wrong.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user’s needs were the center part of the project. I put a lot of focus on the used case that were mentioned in the resources document and try to design my system around the requirement that was related to the user needs. Because the requirements are basically the guideline of the program analysis. They are vital to the making of the program. even concerning the security part of the program. All those elements are being figured out in the requirement gathering. Without the requirement or without considering user needs crafting an application is impossible because you don’t know what you are doing.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
It was a requirement focus technique. Requirements are like a map and without that map it is hard to reach a specific goal which is creating an application. In the future I will try to get more information about the purpose of the application and the technicality of the application.
